# Contribution guide

**Never report security issues on GitHub or other public channels, follow the instruction from [Jenkins Security](https://jenkins.io/security/) to report it on [Jenkins Jira](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org)**

## How to contribute

You can contribute in many ways, and whatever you choose we're grateful!
Source code contribution is the obvious one but we also need your feedback and if you don't really want to participate in the implementation directly you may still have great ideas about features we need.

Please use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jenkinsci/loadrunner-cloud-plugin/issues) if you need to report a bug or request changes/improvements.
Whenever you report a problem please provide information about:

- Plugin version
- Jenkins version
- Operating system
- Description

### Regarding source code contribution

- Create a GitHub issue for your feature/problem you want to solve
- Implement solution on a branch in your fork
- Make sure to include issue number in commit message, and make the message speak for itself
- Once you're done create a pull request and ask at least one of the maintainers for review
  - Remember to title your pull request properly as it is used for release notes

## Code of conduct

Same as Jenkins, applying to all discussions/comments: https://jenkins-ci.org/conduct/
